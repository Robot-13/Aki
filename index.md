    <h1> Hotel Mario <h1>
    <p> <b>Bowser</b>: (<i>laughs</i>) <br>
<b>Mario</b>: Nice of the princess to invite us over for a picnic, eh, Luigi? <br>
<b>Luigi</b>: I hope she made lots of spaghetti! <br>
<b>M</b>: Luigi, look! It's from Bowser. “Dear pesky plumbers: The Koopalings and I have taken over the Mushroom Kingdom. The Princess is now a permanent guest at one of my seven Koopa hotels. I dare you to find her if you can.” We've got to find the Princess. <br>
<b>L</b>: And, you've got to help us. <br>
<b>M</b>: If you need instructions on how to get through the hotels, check out the enclosed instruction book. <br>
~ <br>

<b>M</b>: Looks kind of peaceful. <br>
<b>L</b>: Looks are deceiving when Koopas are involved. <br>
~ <br>

<b>M</b>: Uh-oh! Ow! Ooh. (<i>Coughs</i>.) Where am I? <br>
~ <br>

<b>M</b>: Hey, Princess! <br>
<b>Princess</b>: Oh! <br>
<b>L</b>: How are we going to find the Princess with the power going out? <br>
<b>M</b>: Maybe there's a switch in one of the rooms. Remind me to check. <br>
~ <br>

<b>M</b>: Uh-huh. Here's the problem: too many toasters! You know what they say, "All toasters toast toast!" <br>
~ <br>

<b>M</b>: That ought to do it. <br>
<b>P</b>: Oh! <br>
<b>M</b>: Where'd she go? Gee, it—it—it's kind of dark. <br>
<b>L</b>: You bring a light? <br>
<b>M</b>: No. <br>
<b>L</b>: Well, maybe a Koopa will lend us his! If we ''persuade'' him. <br>
~ <br>

<b>P</b>: Mario! <br>
<b>M</b>: Get ready to catch her. <br>
<b>L</b>: She's not coming down! <br>
<b>M</b>: She's up there! It's hard to see through those clouds. I hope we can get rid of 'em. Get the hint? <br>
~ <br>

<b>M</b>: Hey, you! Get off of my cloud! It's been one of those days. Come on, Luigi. We ain't afraid of no Koopas. <br>
<b>L</b>: Woah! <br>
<b>M</b>: Hurry! <br>
~ <br>

<b>M</b>: Spooky! Where's the Princess? <br>
<b>L</b>: Over there! Look! Wendy's Hotel. <br>
<b>M</b>: Be careful! When you pinch Wendy's pennies, they pinch back. <br>
~ <br>

<b>M</b>: That wasn't so hard. Was it? <br>
<b>P</b>: Boys! <br>
<b>B</b>: (<i>laughs</i>) <br>
<b>L</b>: That's that creepy Bowser's laugh. <br>
<b>M</b>: Look! This is it, Luigi. Remember, where there's smoke... <br>
<b>L</b>: There's fire.
