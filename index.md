    <h1> Hotel Mario <h1>
    <p> [b]Bowser[/b]: ([i]laughs[/i])
[b]Mario[/b]: Nice of the princess to invite us over for a picnic, eh, Luigi?
[b]Luigi[/b]: I hope she made lots of spaghetti!
[b]M[/b]: Luigi, look! It's from Bowser. “Dear pesky plumbers: The Koopalings and I have taken over the Mushroom Kingdom. The Princess is now a permanent guest at one of my seven Koopa hotels. I dare you to find her if you can.” We've got to find the Princess.
[b]L[/b]: And, you've got to help us.
[b]M[/b]: If you need instructions on how to get through the hotels, check out the enclosed instruction book.
~

[b]M[/b]: Looks kind of peaceful.
[b]L[/b]: Looks are deceiving when Koopas are involved.
~

[b]M[/b]: Uh-oh! Ow! Ooh. ([i]Coughs[/i].) Where am I?
~

[b]M[/b]: Hey, Princess!
[b]Princess[/b]: Oh!
[b]L[/b]: How are we going to find the Princess with the power going out?
[b]M[/b]: Maybe there's a switch in one of the rooms. Remind me to check.
~

[b]M[/b]: Uh-huh. Here's the problem: too many toasters! You know what they say, "All toasters toast toast!"
~

[b]M[/b]: That ought to do it.
[b]P[/b]: Oh!
[b]M[/b]: Where'd she go? Gee, it—it—it's kind of dark.
[b]L[/b]: You bring a light?
[b]M[/b]: No.
[b]L[/b]: Well, maybe a Koopa will lend us his! If we ''persuade'' him.
~

[b]P[/b]: Mario!
[b]M[/b]: Get ready to catch her.
[b]L[/b]: She's not coming down!
[b]M[/b]: She's up there! It's hard to see through those clouds. I hope we can get rid of 'em. Get the hint?
~

[b]M[/b]: Hey, you! Get off of my cloud! It's been one of those days. Come on, Luigi. We ain't afraid of no Koopas.
[b]L[/b]: Woah!
[b]M[/b]: Hurry!
~

[b]M[/b]: Spooky! Where's the Princess?
[b]L[/b]: Over there! Look! Wendy's Hotel.
[b]M[/b]: Be careful! When you pinch Wendy's pennies, they pinch back.
~

[b]M[/b]: That wasn't so hard. Was it?
[b]P[/b]: Boys!
[b]B[/b]: ([i]laughs[/i])
[b]L[/b]: That's that creepy Bowser's laugh.
[b]M[/b]: Look! This is it, Luigi. Remember, where there's smoke...
[b]L[/b]: There's fire. </p>
